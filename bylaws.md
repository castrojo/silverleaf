## POLICIES

To promote the aesthetic harmony and continuing attractiveness of Silverleaf and to
facilitate the beneficial operation of the residential areas thereof, the Silverleaf
Association Board has adopted the following Architectural Control Policies and
Procedures. These policies provide for community appearance standards and

within any Unit or outside the boundaries of a Unit, including, without limitation,
landscaping, construction of a Residence or Structure (such as a deck or garage), and
the use and occupancy thereof, shall comply of the bylaws, if the Structure, Residence,
